Build better bots, for matrix!

For an example of a bot made with granolin, see [[https://github.com/cbeo/posterbot][posterbot]] 

** TODO Defing a Bot 

** TODO Event Handlers 
*** Special Variables
**** *room-id*

 The special variable =*room-id*= is available in your =handle-event= methods.
 It will have the value of the Matrix room id in which the event occured. It
 will be =nil= if the event is not a room state nor timeline/message event.

 For example:

 #+begin_src common-lisp
 (defmethod handle-event :after ((cli echo-bot) (ev text-message-event)) 
     (send-text-message cli *room-id* (msg-body ev)))
 #+end_src
